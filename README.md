# Solution
#Our goal is to design a digital web extension that can connect to most smartwatches through the help of Bluetooth to collect physiological measurements and determine when the pop-up screen activates. When downloading this extension, users have the option to personalize how long their screen will time out and an optional selection for when it is active. The design of the extension is similar to many ios and android apps that send notifications when a timer is up. Some apps are designed to motivate the user to continue focusing with an incentive, one popular example of this is growing a tree or dragon eggs. In order to activate the “Take a Break” pop-up screen, the individual’s physiological function must meet the ranges discussed in the research references. Ideally, the pop-up screen should last at least 1-2 minutes and can range longer as desired. The optional selection of when to activate can function just like Do Not Disturb or an on/off button to support times when the pop-up should not disturb things such as calls, exams, etc. As the heart rate, temperature, and stress measures elevate, the pop-up activates and displays a short motivational quote or short actions like “Drink a cup of water”, “Take 3 deep breaths”, etc. Animation that will be aesthetically pleasing in a way to relax the user. And finally, a chat button on the side that the user can use to connect to support if in need to talk to someone.

# Edit: 
#For the final version, the idea of a chat button was a bit too out of scope as we have primarily focused on connecting a watch to a pc with live data and parsing that data to decide whether or not someone is stressed.

# Development & Evaluation Plan
#Our development and evaluation plan will follow a user-centered design process. We will conduct informal interviews and surveys with the students on campus to help us pinpoint everyday things that affect the average student's mental state. We will collect data that we will summarize using thematic analysis. In our prototyping phase, we will ask a sample of students to download and use our extension for a day. During this testing period we will collect qualitative feedback from students and use thematic analysis. Using this feedback, we will be able to make the necessary adjustments to “LifeSaver” so that we can have it prepared for the initial prototype. Our next step is we will bring those same students back to test LifeSaver for another week to rate the new improvements. Students in this evaluation will be asked to use the application during the week to track their mental health on a daily basis and then complete an exit survey. Our final analysis will consist of evaluating data and exit surveys to better understand if our application was helpful and has a positive impact on our subjects mental health. A win for us is making sure that this a go to extension for people that struggle with mental health and ultimately help decrease the suicide rate amongst young teens and adults.
